        <p id="vedal">
            Vedal is the creator of all AIs in the Neuroverse—Both named and unnamed AI were programmed and trained by him. He develops and maintains Neuro, and sometimes joins her on streams in the form of a small cartoon turtle as his VTuber avatar. Not much is known about him, due to his desire to remain anonymous and let Neuro take the spotlight. As a result, the community has spread wild rumors about his age, occupation and appearance.
            <br>What little Vedal has shared with others is that he is largely self-taught, and he's skilled in several programming languages including C#, Python and Unity, all of which are used by Neuro in one way or another. He's born and lives in the UK, enjoys games such as Dwarf Fortress, PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds and Black Ops 3 Zombies, and has a fondness for Banana Rum.
            <br>Neuro however has a very different look from her creator.

        "Neuro-sama is an independent English speaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"> AI</a>VTuber created by Vedal. Unlike many other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber" >VTubers</a> that have claimed to be AI as part of a lore or character description, all her movements, speech, and gameplay are powered by different generative AI systems to emulate a human streamer's actions and interactions with her viewers. She streams on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987"> vedal987</a> channel on Twitch."
