#My Attempt of learning OOP :) i guess
---
a simple mini project where i put in practice all the basics of Object-Oriented Programming Are the following:

- Encapsulation
- Inherentance
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

Today is **10-01-2026, Saturday, 13:00hrs...**, and i am really looking foward to understan all this concept in my dummy brain...

1. Abstraction: is where we hide certain data from the outsideword 
 it could be reache from abstract methods and interfaces. Abstrac class Character where belong to a certain group
2. Encaplutaion: when i have fully control of the data,propeties, at hand. meaing only me can chage the data
3.Compostion: where i use other classes to create a "has a" relaticon. 
 here character has an invertory.

 ##Notes:
 ---
 what i learn within this 8 months is every properties must fullfil only one single
 responsability; likewise in methods, or function, must only do one single thing.
