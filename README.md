All started on May 1, 2026 at 20:00hrs. all thanks to my computer teacher that taught me how to create a very simple form on VBA. later I start to learn python, html, css, typescript, react. This repository is just an evidence of my very awful beginning code... i guess :3. 

Today is 2026-02-09 Sunday at 13:00 and I am currently learning how to use git to create my respository
